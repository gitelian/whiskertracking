% SEQ2REFLECTIVE_MEASURES Function that converts high speed video of whiskers
% to 2d histogram.
% Extract angle information from a single reflective whisker.
% IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ONLY ONE WHISKER IS REFLECTIVE AND THAT THE
% REFLECTIVE PORTION IS LINEAR!
%
% Input: path to seq high speed movie file
%
% Output
% angles: vector of whisker angles for each frame.
% mean_counts: 2d histogram (probability) values for movie.
% lines: cell array that contains line objects for each frame computed using
% a Hough transform.
% img: 3d matrix of image values. ij correspond to pixels and the third
% dimension corresponds to frames.

-----
% track_reflective_whisker takes no arguments. It prompts the user to select a
% high speed video directory to analyze and to enter in some details about the
% experiment such as when the video began recording, when it stopped, when
% the object started moving (i.e. stim period began), and the frame rate of
% the camera. The processed data will be saved in the directory:
% 'E:\TrackingData\ProcessedMeasurements\' and will contain cell arrays
% with angle, curvature, phase, and other information for each trial. All
% vectors contained in the cell are the same lenghth and can be easily
% indexed during analysis.

% 20140625 update (GT): changed setpoint code to get a more accurate measure of
% setpoint.
%
% 20150514 update (GT): changed filter settings to get a more accurate
% measurement of phase. Also, adapted code to process videos of a single
% reflective whisker (painted with reflected paint).

% whiskers2histogram
% Convert high speed videos of whiskers to 2d histograms.
% The histograms can be used later to extract overall setpoint and amplitude.
%
% Scratch script for testing.
